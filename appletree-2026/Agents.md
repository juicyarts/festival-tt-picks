## Timetable Extraction

The official timetable is published as a **PNG image** (and PDF) on the program page. Text cannot be extracted programmatically — it requires manual transcription.

**Workflow:**
1. Open https://appletreegarden.de/programm/
2. Download the timetable image / PDF
3. Manually transcribe artist names, times, and stages into the markdown table
4. Verify against the line-up page for artist links

## Artist Data Format

Each table row follows this structure:

```markdown
| Artist | Time | Stage | Rating | Genre | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Artist Name](spotify-link) | HH:MM–HH:MM | Stage Name | ++ / + / — | Genre / Genre | One-line summary from official bio |
```

### Fields

- **Artist**: Linked to Spotify (or SoundCloud if no Spotify). Unlinked if no streaming profile found.
- **Time**: Start–end from the timetable. DJ/headliner sets typically 60–90 min, live acts ~45 min.
- **Stage**: Keep original German stage names:
  - `Große Bühne`, `Tiefes Holz`, `Wald Bühne`, `Zirkus Zelt`, `Oase`, `Glitzer Salon`
  - `?` = unknown (check timetable)
- **Rating**:
  - `++` = don't miss
  - `+` = priority
  - `—` = unrated / skip
- **Genre**: Concise, from official bio + MusicBrainz/Wikipedia cross-reference.
- **Summary**: One sentence describing the artist's sound and origin, sourced from the official bio on appletreegarden.de, translated to English.

### Adding a New Artist

1. Find the artist on https://appletreegarden.de/line-up-2026/
2. Open their detail page for bio text (in German, translate to English)
3. Find their Spotify profile (often linked on the detail page or search manually)
4. Find their time slot in the timetable image
5. Add row to the correct day's table in `schedule.md`

## Schedule HTML Page

The schedule is rendered by `index.html` via:
- `pages.json` maps `appletree-2026` slug → `appletree-2026/schedule.md`
- Client-side markdown parser converts `.md` to HTML on the fly
- Tables become card layout on mobile (<520px)

## Notifications

Notifications are stored in `notifications.md` alongside `schedule.md`. They are rendered in the **Notifications** tab of the app.

### Format

```markdown
## ℹ️ Info
- Info notification text

## ℹ️ Info
- Another info notification in its own block

## ⚠️ Warnings
- Warning notification text

## 🚨 Emergency / Awareness
- Urgent notification text
```

### Category Order

Notification blocks must always appear in this order (emergency first):
1. `## 🚨 Awareness` blocks — always at the top
2. `## ⚠️ Warnings` blocks — time-sensitive or safety warnings
3. `## ℹ️ Info` blocks — general information, feature announcements

### Notification Blocks

Each `## ...` heading plus the list item(s) that follow it is one notification block.

- Add every new notification in a **new block** with the appropriate heading.
- Do **not** append a new notification as another bullet inside an existing block.
- The unread badge counts notification **blocks**, not bullet items inside a block.
- Keep all `🚨 Awareness` / `⚠️ Warnings` blocks above all `ℹ️ Info` blocks.

### Feature Announcements

Every time a new feature is added to the app, add a new `## ℹ️ Info` block explaining:
- What the feature does
- How to use it

Keep it short — one list item per feature block. Example:
```markdown
## ℹ️ Info
- **Locations tab**: tap the map to drop markers for your tent (⛺), meeting spot (📍), or yourself (🙂). Long-press a marker to label or remove it
```

### Adding Notifications

Notifications are requested via **GitHub Issues** on the repo. To add one:

1. A user opens an issue describing the notification
2. An agent edits `notifications.md` and adds a new block under the appropriate category
3. Follow the block order above — emergency/warnings always at the top
4. The agent commits and pushes — GitHub Actions redeploys the site automatically

### Factual Sources

Always verify notification facts against the official festival info page:
- https://appletreegarden.de/infos/ (general info, awareness, accessibility, cashless)
- https://appletreegarden.de/programm/ (timetable changes)

Only include information that is confirmed on the official site. Mark speculative or user-reported info clearly.
